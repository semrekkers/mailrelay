# Mailrelay

Mailrelay is a single container email relay server intended for forwarding email to a personal email account like Gmail or Outlook. For those who donâ€™t like to forward their email to a service like Gmail, it also has POP3 support.

## Quick start

If you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, you can just run the quick start script to spin up an experimental service:

    $ ./quick-start.sh

**Don't use this in production!**

## Installation instructions

Coming soon
